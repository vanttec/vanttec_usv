# The right-hand convention applies, where positive rotation is indicated by the direction in which
# the fingers on your right hand curl when your thumb is pointing in the direction of the axis of rotation.
#
# NED convention:
#   Roll: Rotation about the X axis
#   Pitch: Rotation about the Y axis
#   Yaw: Rotation about the down axis. Zero when the X axis is pointing North.
#
# ENU convention:
#   Roll: Rotation around X axis
#   Pitch: Rotation around Y axis (opposite sign compared to NED)
#   Yaw: Rotation about the up axis. Zero when the X axis is pointing East. (opposite sign compared to NED)
