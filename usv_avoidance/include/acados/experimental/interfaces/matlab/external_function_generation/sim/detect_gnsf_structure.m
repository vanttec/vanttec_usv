%% Description
% This function takes a CasADi implicit ODE or index-1 DAE model "model" 
% consisting of a CasADi expression f_impl in the symbolic CasADi
% variables x, xdot, u, z, (and possibly parameters p), which are also part
% of the model, as well as a model name.
% It will create a struct "gnsf" containing all information needed to use
% it with the gnsf integrator in acados.
% Additionally it will create the struct "reordered_model" which contains
% the permuted state vector and permuted f_impl, in which additionally some
% functions, which were made part of the linear output system of the gnsf,
% have changed signs.

% Options: transcribe_opts is a Matlab struct consisting of booleans:
%   print_info: if extensive information on how the model is processed
%       is printed to the console.
%   generate_gnsf_model: if the neccessary C functions to simulate the gnsf
%       model with the acados implementation of the GNSF exploiting
%       integrator should be generated.
%   generate_gnsf_model: if the neccessary C functions to simulate the
%       reordered model with the acados implementation of the IRK
%       integrator should be generated.
%   check_E_invertibility: if the transcription method should check if the
%       assumption that the main blocks of the matrix gnsf.E are invertible
%       holds. If not, the method will try to reformulate the gnsf model
%       with a different model, such that the assumption holds.
