This folder contains experimental code that was used to evaluate the effort of creating a swig interface for acados_c interface. The result was very complex code in the high-level language. Because the concurrently developed MEX approach seemed easier at the time of writing this, this approach was abandoned.

To reproduce the results, replace the swig/acados.i with the one in this folder and try to run one of the contained matlab examples.
